Hangout Receptionist
======

A simple extension for auto-joining when invited to hangouts.

The main use-case is providing telepresence, since remote friends of
a +page or user can now begin hangouts on-demand, without requiring
work on the part of the maintainer.

The extension can be extended with an unsafe NPAPI plugin for controlling
monitor sleep-state, so that a monitor will turn on only when an
active hangout is occuring.

To Do
-----
* Detect when the account has been logged out.
* Occassionally empty hangouts will be invited after a session finishes.
